                            various funds available to support deserving

                            assistance to be considerate and modest as our
                            funds are not unlimited and different sources of
                            funding come with different limitations. However,

                            PLISS. If you are accepted for PLISS, and have
                            requested financial assistance, then please check with
                            the organizers before booking any travel.</p>
