        <h4>How much does it cost?</h4>
        <p>Registration is â‚¬500. It covers a shared room for the whole
          week, breakfasts, lunches, as well as an excursion. Registrants
          only have to pay for their dinners in the many cosy, and
          reasonably priced, restaurants in the village.</p>

      <li>
        <h4>Can I get support to attend the Summer School?</h4>
       <p>If you would be unable to attend without financial
         assistance, let us know. We have some funds to support
         registrations of deserving students. We cannot cover travel
         costs though.</p>
